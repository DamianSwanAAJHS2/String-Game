# String-Game

A **Simple** String game in python.

I was messing around **mostly** when i made this.

But i thought it be fun to share with anyone who **finds** this.

And as I get bored i might **improve it**.

Sadly the colab notebook is only **avalible** inside an **.org**.

but i will post any **major** changes here!.
